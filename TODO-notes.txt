DATABASE:
Switch from ID (auto-increment) to CUID as unique identifier in production?
	•	Use Auto-Increment IDs for simple, single-database applications with performance needs and no distribution requirements.
	•	Use UUIDs when you need global uniqueness across distributed systems, with security in mind.
	•	Use CUIDs in high-concurrency distributed systems where collision resistance, rough ordering, and readability are beneficial.
