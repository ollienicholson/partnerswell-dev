[] Call transcripts user flow refactor
  Notes: bring all meeting assignment and import into call transcription flow

  [x] get basic frontend flow working
  [x] show empty table in partner accounts page if no transcripts have been saved to the account
  [x] remove flow from partner accounts page

  [x] add new table in partner accounts page to display final chatgpt output - which will look alot like the capability table in call transcript user flow
    [x] Table headings - partner-accounts/[accountId]/[meetingId]/page.tsx


  [x] get transcript id and make another call to fireflies to return the call transcript
    [x] open new page: same format as: src/app/(main)/partner-accounts/[accountId]/[meetingId]
    
    []  MM or II assignment will take place before sending raw text to chatgpt for parsing
    [] save to associated partner account
        [] save transcript id to account based on account id
        [] store speaker>name against sentences>speaker_name,  so that when parsing to chatgpt they know who is saying what
  [] open in partner account to view final output



consider using Image instead of img for nextjs warnings
