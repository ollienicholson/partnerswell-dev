influence indicator (refers to a potential sales deal with a company)
> list of influence indicators:
> 1. WestPac
> 2. Commbank
> 3. ANZ
> 4. BNZ
>> for the influence indicator selected, you then pass a list of phases:
  think of a phase like a check point in the sales cycle

  (see screenshot) this is a phase list of influence indicators 
    - so lets say you select WestPac as an influence indicator ( this should be a static list of companies for dev purposes i.e. banks for which we have sales deals in the pipeline)
    - you then parse that influence indicator ( aka company name) along with the list of phases to chatGPT in order to get the response you want
    Here's the template for the request:


    If (Influence Indicator) {
      OpenAPIRequest: {
      "You are a sales professional working in the B2B partnerships industry.
      Your task is to analyse this call transcript to identify success factors related to a specific phase of the sales deal with  {pass in "influence indicator aka company name"}.
      Your analysis of this call transcript data must be categorised into the following phases:

        Partner Opportunity Closed
      }

      Return your response in .json format with the following key-value pairs:
        - phase_name: the phase of the sales deal
        - description: a description of what was discussed related to the specific phase"
      }
    }

    If (Maturity Map) {
