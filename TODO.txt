ChatGPT Integration:
--------------------

influence indicator (which refers to a sales deal)
> list of influence indicators:
> 1. WestPac
> 2. Commbank
> 3. ANZ
> 4. BNZ
>> for the influence indicator selected, you then pass a list of phase:
  think of the phase like a check point in the sales cycle

  (see screenshot) this is a phase list of influence indicators - so lets say you select the WesPac as an influence indicator ( this hsould be a static list of companies i.e. banks for which we have deals in the pipeline) you would then parse that company name along with the list of phases to chatGPT  in order to get the response you want
